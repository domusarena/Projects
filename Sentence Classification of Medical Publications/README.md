# Classifications of Sentences from Medical Publications

This project involved the application of natural language 
processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentences of 
medical publications into important predefined categories.
It was the second assignment in a unit I studied at university
called COMP3220 Document Processing and the Semantic Web.

It initially involved some crucial preprocessing of the data
and the creation of some important statistics and 
visualisations. I then fit to the data, test and investigate 
several models including a Naive Bayes Classifier using 
scikit-learn and a simple neural network and a recurrent 
neural network using Keras.
